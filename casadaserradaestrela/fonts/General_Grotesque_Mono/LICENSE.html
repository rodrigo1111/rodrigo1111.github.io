<li><h2>Grant of License</h2>
<p>  <section></p>
<p>This License is directed to use of the Font Software as webfonts (“Software” or “Webfonts”). This non-exclusive, revocable license grants you limited rights to use the Font Software to style HTML and SVG documents using the CSS @font-face mechanism. The use of the Font Software for use in web accessible forms is permitted. Other embedding or linking uses or techniques, such as PDF, EPUB, iOS and/or Android native applications and/or in Cufón or sIFR, are not permitted. Downloading the General Type Webfonts for use on a desktop, laptop or workstation is controlled and only permitted under a different license which must be purchased separately. If you wish to use and/or install the Webfont Font Software on your desktop or personal computer or on a server for use and access by a desktop or personal computing device, you must purchase a separate license. Any other editable use of the Software, such as in templates or for use in the creation of customizable designs or products requires the purchase of a separate license.</p>
<p><aside>This paragraph means: This license only applies to using fonts on the web via the @font-face CSS tag. You cannot use these fonts for other uses. You need to purchase a different license for other uses. If your site is a method for creating customized products, physical or otherwise, you must upgrade your license to cover this use.</aside></p>
<p>  </section></p>
</li>
<li><h2>Formats</h2>
<p>  <section>
The Font Software will be transmitted for your use in the EOT and WOFF formats. General Type reserves the right to include or omit additional formats at its discretion in the future.</p>

<li><h2>Pageview Limitations</h2>
<p>  <section></p>
<p>A pageview is one request for the viewing of a page of your website. The average monthly traffic of your website, measured in pageviews, over the span of six consecutive months, must not exceed the amount shown on your sales receipt. If it does, you must purchase a license upgrade for the increased pageview amount.</p>
<p><aside>This paragraph means: This defines a page view as a single request for the viewing of a page on your website and the average monthly traffic on your website must match the page-views you identified when you licensed the webfonts.

</li>
<li><h2>Webfonts File Protection</h2>
<p>  <section></p>
